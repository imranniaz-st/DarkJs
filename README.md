## Why DarkJS Should be ideal for you 
Darcase is a Chrome extension that is still under development. The main goal of this development and this extension is to exploit API testing and application and bring out the things inside it. This extension will help us developers and engineers who forget something in JS. For example, you can forget something in API there. You will not need a custom word list. This extension will create APIs and points for you. This extension is currently on development purple.
